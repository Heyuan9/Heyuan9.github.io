Hello, I am a Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing ([CLSP](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/)) working on Natural Language Processing, advised by Prof. [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/). Before joining JHU, I was a student at Yale University, where I first learned and researched NLP under the guidance of Prof. [Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/). My research interests are natural language processing, and applied mathematics and statistics, especially in health, social, and business applications. I regard many practical problems as an optimization problem with partially observed data. How to make the most use of the limited data and how to maximize the quantified outcome through simple, elegant ideas and rigorous definitions are my primary focuses during research. 

My current research interests include (take the medical domain for example):

* Evaluation of Open-ended Machine Generated Text: Past evaluations require human-written answers as a gold standard, and compare lexical or semantic similarities of machine-generated text with gold answers. How can we evaluate diverse LLM-generated text with no human annotations? My current work focuses on factuality, completeness, and safety evaluation of LLM answers to patient questions.

* Utilization of Web and Knowledge: Web information is mixed with misinformation and factual information. How can we identify misinformation based on the goal of study and optimally utilize the filtered knowledge to reach our goal?

To scale up affordable and accessible healthcare services, I envision one day chatbots can act at a trained clinical expert level to understand, comfort, and guide patients to recover. 

If you are a student looking for research opportunities in clinical/medical NLP, please fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/XJY3W9TM5jeR6ov23) and email me with your research interest and NLP-related experience.

## Miscellaneous
I love to help people take photos, and my aesthetic composition always gives them happiness and touching feelings during traveling and daily life.

My parents raised a dog during my undergraduate time. She is 5 years old now and has a similar personality to mine when I was a kid... 🤨

My favorite book and its adapted musical is Les Misérables by Victor Hugo.
